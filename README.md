This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning model designed to predict car prices based on factors like make, model, year, mileage, and condition.
The project utilizes Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn to develop and evaluate the model.
It includes data preprocessing, model selection (linear regression and decision trees), and performance assessment using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
The model aims to provide a reliable tool for estimating vehicle values in the dynamic car market.
